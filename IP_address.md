# What is a network?

- A `network` is nothing more than two or more computers connected to each other so that they can exchange information, such as e-mail messages or documents, or share resources, such as disk storage or printers. In most cases, this connection is made via electrical cables that carry the information in the form of electrical signals. But in some cases, other types of connections are used. For example, fiber-optic cables let computers communicate at extremely high speeds by using impulses of light. Wireless networks let computers communicate by using radio signals, so the computers arenâ€™t restricted by physical cables.

### Definition:
- An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes:

2. **Locating Devices**: It provides the location of the device in terms of its network and helps route data to the correct destination.
